## Python

This is a GitHub Repository providing series of phases diving deep into the core mechanisms of the Python language. This repo dose not provide instruction on how to install and run Python; instead prvides codes respective to the phases and its elements. Each pahses will have its elements on which codes will be shown with explanation.

There are three pashes to this repository and within these phases are various elements. Concepts are drawn from various books, sites, and repositories. A list is available in the [Appendices](https://github.com/n-shaikh/python/tree/Appendices).

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/n-shaikh/python/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
